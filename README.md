# Fault-Simulation

This project is a simple fault simulator built for the Testing for Digital Integrated Circuits Course at the Lebanese American University (LAU). It includes the following objectives:



➢ Analyze circuit description based on netlist

➢ Generate true-value simulation for different test vectors

➢ Apply stuck-at-fault model

➢ Experiment with benchmarks

➢ Develop a fault simulator
