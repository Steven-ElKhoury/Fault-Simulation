# Fault-Simulation

This project is a simple fault simulator developed as part of the Testing for Digital Integrated Circuits course at the Lebanese American Univeristy (LAU). The simulator achieves the following objectives:

➢ Analyze circuit description based on netlist

➢ Generate true-value simulation for different test vectors

➢ Apply stuck-at-fault model

➢ Experiment with benchmarks

➢ Develop a fault simulator
